# Eyes
Eyes that track your mouse movement.

The basics of the code was provided to me by my MIT course. I refactored the code to create seperate JS and HTML files and to add a second moving eye.

## How to Run
To run on your own device, download all the files (except for the LICENSE file and the README file) and save them in one folder. Open the index.html document in your browser to view the moving eyes!

## Future Improvements
A few improvments that may be fun to implement: change the style of the eyes and page background.

## License 
See the attached LICENSE file.
